# Concurrent-and-multithread-software-using-Java



The goal of this work is to implement several image lters using a sequential and multithreaded approach, to study how to maximize the eventual performance gain and describe the results.

There are several image lters available in photo editing software. These lters transform an input image in an output image where at least some pixels are converted by the application of some calculation. Examples are, converting pictures from colour to grayscale, increase brightness or apply some type of distortion. For this project we will dene the lters described in the following sections but others can be implemented. Note that we will consider images as matrices of pixels (Color objects) and an API with simple image processing features will be provided.

The image filtering should be used with:

1. Multithread-based processing;
2. Threadpool based processing;
3. Concurrent implementation.
